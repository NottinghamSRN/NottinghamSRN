The SCRUBS Student Research Network is a newly-developed student focused, network, aiming to get student more involved in medical research. 
Medical research is the only method by which most medical advances are developed, and it is important, be it lab-based or clinical projects. Furthermore, research is becoming more and more pertinent to the developing CV of the trainee doctor, even at F1 level. However, research opportunities can be hard to come by at medical school. The aim of the SRN is to give all students an equal opportunity to either start gaining or further develop their research skills.

SRN was the developed by Paul Thomas (then SCRUBS President), Matt Green (then SCRUBS Vice President and Treasurer) and Nicole Asemota (then SCRUBS General Secretary), although the idea for a research network had been suggested for a long time. Over the past year, they, as well as the rest of the SCRUBS committee, have worked tirelessly to bring this idea to life. And so, it is with great honour, the SCRUBS Research Network is presented to you today.

We hope you enjoy it.
