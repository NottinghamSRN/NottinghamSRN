title: Nottingham SCRUBS Research Network
---

The SCRUBS research network (SRN) is a tool created by the SCRUBS Nottingham University Surgical Society to create a research mentorship scheme, whereby surgeons can gain assistance with projects they are running, and students can gain valuable research experience. This scheme is not only about enhancing a student's CV, but is about gaining skills and experience, as well as receiving guidance and advice. 

We are supported by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS), the East Midlands Surgical Academic Network (EMSAN) as well as other collaboratives and consultants from various University of Nottingham - affiliated hospitals. 

All SCRUBS Members are eligible. If you do not have SCRUBS Membership but with to be involved, go to https://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/healthcare/medsoc/clubsocs/scrubs/ and buy membership now!
