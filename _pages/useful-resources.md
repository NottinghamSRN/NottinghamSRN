## Generating Students for Randomised Trials (GRANULE) COURSE - Run by STARSurg

"When students graduate from medical school, they are trained to make a diagnosis and begin treatment. They are able to prescribe drugs, request X-rays, and perform simple invasive procedures directly. Current UK medical undergraduate curricula, however, do not train students to recruit patients into clinical research studies.

GRANULE aims to teach students how to recruit patients into randomised controlled trials. Gathering a world class faculty of international trial leaders, the course will cover principles of equipoise, communication using trials ‘language’ and give you practical experience with simulated patients. This will give you a skill set for meaningful participation in future RCTS. We will link successful students with ongoing and developing trial management groups.

The course will run in Birmingham on Monday 19th June 2017. A welcome meal and icebreaker exercises will take place from 18:00, Sunday 18th June 2017 -  attendance at both parts of the event is expected.

Our first GRANULE course was delivered in London in May 2016 with excellent feedback from course participants. We will provide the evening meal on 18th June as well as overnight accommodation. In addition, we will reimburse part of your travel expenses*

*Receipts will be required. Maximum travel expenses available will be dependent from where you are traveling from:
