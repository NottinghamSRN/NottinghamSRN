This study aims to determine the type of grafts used and reasons for use of different coronary artery bypass graft conduits across UK trusts. In order to do this, we will need a UK-wide group of students that will visit their local cardiothoracic units and administer a short questionnaire to cardiothoracic consultants performing coronary artery bypass surgery.
