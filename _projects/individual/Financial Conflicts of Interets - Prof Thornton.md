Reassess conflicts of interests in literature concerning Menopausal Hormonal Therapy.

Past surveys of this suggested that it was common and led to biased opinions.  However, these are now about ten years out of date. There is scope for an up to date survey of this issue. The project would be entirely literature based. Professor Thornton has lists of conflicted authors, which could be updated. The second task is to measure how often such conflicts are omitted and how often there is evidence of partisanship in the language used in the reviews by such authors.
